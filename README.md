### Agile and Scrum
#### The Principles of Agile
1) Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuos delivery of valuable software
2) Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competetive advantage.
3) Deliver working doftware frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4) Business people and developers must work together throughout the project
5) Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done
6) The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-face conversations
7) Working software is the primary measure of progress
8) Agile processes promote sustainable development
9) Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
10) Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential
11) The best architextures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12) At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly

#### 3 Principles of Scrum
1) Transparency
   Everyone presents the facts as is & collectively collaborates for the common organization objective. No one has a hidden agenda.
2) Inspection 
   Not done by an inspector but by everyone on the Scrum Team. The inspection can be done for the product processes, people aspects, practices
3) Adaptation
   Adaptation is about continuous improvement, to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone should reflect on how to improve

#### Scrum Roles

##### Product Owner
- Key stakeholders who should have deep understanding of the product and communicates with both the team and other stakeholders

##### Scrum Master
- Ensures the team keeps to the values of Scrum, facilitates meetings and removes

##### Development Team
- Effectively 3-9 people
- Decide how the work will be done
### User Stories
#### Format 
- As a < type of user > I want < goal > so that <reason> 
  
- User stories do not include all the details - they are only a pointer to the real requirement
#### Three amigos meetings in Agile Development
  - Three representatives in Agile :
      - Tester
      - Development 
      - Business analyst

### Acceptance Criteria
  - Sets the boundaries of the user story 
#### Structure
  - *Given* 
       - And
  - *When*
      - And
  - *Then*
  
 ##### Example

**C** - Could have

Describes a requirement which is considered desirable but not necessary

**W** - Won't have
